# Energitic Pipeline Project

## Overview
The Energitic Pipeline project is designed to analyze and visualize energy production data from turbines. This specific dataset contains information for October 2025, including the amount of energy produced, planned maintenance stops, and unplanned outages.

## Files
- **Production_2025_10.csv**: This file includes the following columns:
  - **date**: The date of the recorded data.
  - **turbin_id**: The identifier for the turbine.
  - **energie_kWh**: The amount of energy produced in kilowatt-hours.
  - **arret_planifie**: Indicates whether there was a planned stop (1 for yes, 0 for no).
  - **arret_non_planifie**: Indicates whether there was an unplanned stop (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Usage
To utilize the data in `Production_2025_10.csv`, you can load it into a data analysis tool or programming environment (such as Python with pandas) to perform various analyses, including:
- Total energy production over the month.
- Analysis of downtime due to planned and unplanned stops.
- Visualization of energy production trends over time.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed to handle CSV files and perform data analysis.
